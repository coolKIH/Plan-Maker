# Plan Maker

##  How did it come into being?
Our software Engineering instructor told us to write a simple program using Ruby. Without a second thought, I decided to make a program to help with daily planning. This program must be able to allow user to add new items anytime they want and remove some when needed. The display style must be easygoing and the most recent plan items must appear on the top. Simple as it may seem, I think it practical.

##  Usage
Download the source files and run  
  ruby main.rb  
That's it!
